## 1. Introduction

Breast cancer is a significant health concern affecting millions of women worldwide. Early detection plays a crucial role in improving survival rates and treatment outcomes. In recent years, deep learning algorithms have shown promising results in medical image analysis, including breast cancer detection through mammography images.

This project aims to perform a comparative analysis of two popular deep learning models, VGG16 and ResNet50, for developing an accurate breast cancer detection algorithm. By evaluating and comparing the performance of these models on the INbreast dataset, which contains 280 mammography images, we aim to identify the most effective architecture for this specific medical imaging task.

## 2. Dataset

The INbreast dataset, consisting of 280 mammography images, is used in this project. The dataset is a publicly available benchmark dataset specifically designed for breast cancer detection. Each image is labeled as Benign or Malignant. The dataset has been preprocessed and split into training and testing sets to ensure unbiased evaluation.

## 3. Methodology

The comparative analysis follows a standardized methodology to ensure a fair comparison between VGG16 and ResNet50. Both models will be trained using the same INbreast dataset and optimization parameters. The primary steps involved in the methodology are as follows:

- Data Preprocessing: Data augmentation techniques are applied to increase the dataset's diversity and prevent overfitting.
- Model Architecture: Both VGG16 and ResNet50 architectures are implemented with appropriate modifications to adapt to the binary classification task.
- Model Training: The models are trained on the training dataset using the same optimizer and learning rate schedule.
- Model Evaluation: The performance of each model is assessed on the validation dataset using various evaluation metrics.
- Model Comparison: Based on the evaluation results, a comparative analysis of VGG16 and ResNet50 is conducted to determine their effectiveness for breast cancer detection.

## 4. Implementation

The implementation of the comparative analysis is done in Python using popular deep learning libraries like TensorFlow and Keras. The code for both VGG16 and ResNet50 models, data preprocessing, training, and evaluation will be provided in this repository.

## 5. Results

The results section presents the performance metrics and evaluation scores of both VGG16 and ResNet50 models. It includes accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and other relevant metrics. Additionally, graphical representations may be used to showcase the models' performance.

## 6. Conclusion

The conclusion summarizes the findings of the comparative analysis and identifies the better-performing model for breast cancer detection in mammography images. It also discusses the implications of the results and potential areas of improvement for future research.
